hfsprescue 0.1 20101130 by Elmar Hanlhofer http://www.plop.at

hfsprescue scans a damaged image file or partition that is formatted with
HFS+. You can restore your files and directories, even when it's not possible 
to mount it with your operating system. Your files and directories will be
stored in the directory './restored' in your current directory. The HFS+ file
or partition will not be changed. So you need enough space to copy out the
files from the HFS+ file system. Important infos will be logged to
'hfsprescue.log'. The directory structure will be stored in 'foldertable.txt'
and is used to restore the directory structure and directory names.

This is the first version. Maybe, you will be not able to restore all files
and directories, but you should get the most back. However, its possible to
make the program better and rescue all files.

You have to complete 3 steps to restore your files:

 1) run 'hfsprescue [device node|image file]' this restores your files
 2) run 'hfsprescue -d' to create the script to restore the directory structure
 3) run 'hfsprescue -s' to restore the directory structure and directory names

Example: hfsprescue /dev/sdb2
         hfsprescue -v /dev/sdb2   verbose infos on the screen
